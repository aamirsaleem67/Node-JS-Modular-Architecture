# Node js modular architecture üõ°Ô∏è

This is the example repository inspired from the blog post ['Bulletproof node.js project architecture'](https://softwareontheroad.com/ideal-nodejs-project-structure?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme)

As compared to original example this repository contains modular structure, Mysql(Typeorm) as db instead of Mongo and some more tweaks as well.

## Development

We use `node` version `10.15.0`

```
nvm install 10.15.0
```

```
nvm use 10.15.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with

```
npm run start
```
